    <p>The Earth does not revolve around the Sun on a perpendicular axis. It is tilted at an angle of 23.5 degrees relative to our orbital plane. This tilt is formally called obliquity. The tilt is believed to have been incurred due to a collision with a planet-sized sized body called Theia. Not only did the collision tilt the planet, but the resulting debris is believed to have concentrated mid-air to form our moon.</p>
    <p>Throughout our annual journey around the Sun, the northern axis points in the same direction in space, towards the star Polaris or the North Star. The obliquity is affected by the distribution of mass, such that land and ice sheets in the northern hemisphere make the top heavier. The planet then revolves like a ping-pong ball with gum stuck on its top – in a lopsided manner.</p>
