      <h1> Bad Website </h1>

        <p> My first impression when seeing this website is this looks like someone we would make in this class. That is not necessarily bad, but the website is basic. It reminds me of the retheme project we did at the beginning of the semester. There is a basic outline including: a header, floating image, navigation bar, body and footer. The color scheme is appropriate and not over whelming, but not anything special.The links all work and the website is easy to navigate which is good. Yet, there is a feature of "quick links," that I think is a little random and would work better under the navigation bar or in a different spot of the website. The body of the home page has minimal information; it only has news and announcements along with a slide show of random important messages. When looking at the code I noticed a feature we talked about today that makes the website mobile friendly. Once the screen hits a certain size the navigation bar becomes a drop down bar. I thought this was unique and good for a website. Also within the code I noticed one table which I think is appropriately used in the website and fitting at the bottom of the body before the footer. The last thing that I noticed about the website is that all the elements are broken down as div elements. I think this could be better organized and would help the website look less basic. Right now with all the elements being divs the programer has set sizes and made an overall basic layout that could be better used for the college.</p>
       <h1> Good Websites </h1>

          <p> This website is very appealing from first glance. There is a header, nav bar, search feature, slide show of photos, body, and footer. I really like their background with multiple photos and color that fit very well. Their also is multiple navigation bars, a search bar, and minimal information on the home page that make it easy to follow. Looking through the code they used a mix of divs, ids, and classes. I was interested to see that they had a lot of padding elements, which made the website look more organized and professional. I was also surprised to see some symbols they used as we have learned to avoid most symbols as html doesn't read them. Lastly, they used elements to make the website readable in any size window which is unique compared to Dawson, as theirs can go much smaller and the layout doesn't change as much but still changed to flow better. Although at the small size some text does overlap, which means they could improve in this section a bit. Overall, I think MSU-Billings website is very user friendly and appealing. This is my favorite site of the three</p>
<li><a href="https://www.milescc.edu/">Miles Community College</a></li>
        <p> I chose to talk about Miles Community College as they do have a good website, but is a good comparison to Dawson Community College as they are similar in size, goals, and location. The first thing that stood out to me about their website is how the background image remains fixed and the information scrolls on top. I think the picture they chose as the background isn't the best photo, but works for the website. I think a nature photo would be better fitting though. I also noticed that they do not have a navigation bar at the top of the page like most do. This navigation bar is in the footer which in not super convienent but is unique and works just fine. There are other navigation bars such as a drop down menu at the very top of the screen, but this is easily over looked. The main navigation bar in the middle is simple but very easy to follow and helpful. I do think they should make the symbols links as well though and not just the words. While going through the code I was able to follow this website better than either of the other two as they used the comment feature a lot and organized things similarly to how we have learned but it is in JavaScript, which I don't completely follow. Beyond this they use sizing appropriately and are a mobile friendly site just like the other two. Overall, Miles Community College has a really good website, which was a bit surprising to me. </p>
