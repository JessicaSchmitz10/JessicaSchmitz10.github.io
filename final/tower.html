    <h1>Tower Fall</h1>
    <p> Located in the northeastern part of Yellowstone near Tower Junction, the fall plunges a stunning 132 feet. The unusual rock columns north of the fall were created by lava flow the cracked as it cooled. And interestingly enough, up until 1986, visitors could see a large boulder perched on the edge of where the fall drops. It fell victim to gravity in June 1986, but if you see Jackson's photo of the Tower Fall, you'll spot the boulder.</p>
    <p>While you can no longer hike to the bottom of the falls because of severe erosion, you can walk past the Tower Fall overlook for three-quarters of a mile to see Tower Creek flow into the Yellowstone River. Look for bighorn sheep, peregrine falcons, osprey, red-tailed hawks. Bears do visit the area, but black bears are more common than grizzlies.</p>
    <h1>Roosevelt </h1>
    <p>The roosevelt area is famous for the wildlife that is often found here and the geology. The geology of the Tower-Roosevelt area are varied. Major landforms are expressions of geologic events that helped shape much of the Yellowstone area. Absaroka volcanics, glaciation, and erosion have left features as varied as Specimen Ridge's petrified trees to the gorges along the Yellowstone River's Black Canyon and the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone. Mt. Washburn and the Absaroka Range are both remnants of ancient volcanic events that formed the highest peaks in the Tower District. Ancient eruptions, perhaps 45 to 50 million years ago, buried the forests of Specimen Ridge in ash and debris flows. The columnar basalt formations near Tower Fall, the volcanic breccias of the "towers" themselves, and numerous igneous outcrops all reflect the district's volcanic history.Later, glacial events scoured the landscape, exposing the stone forests and leaving evidence of their passage throughout the district. The glacial ponds and huge boulders (erratics) between the Lamar and Yellowstone rivers are remnants left by the retreating glaciers. Lateral and terminal moraines are common in these areas. Such evidence can also be found in the Hellroaring and Slough creek drainages, on Blacktail Plateau, and in the Lamar Valley.The eroding power of running water has been at work in the district for many millions of years. The pinnacles of Tower Fall, the exposed rainbow colors of the Grand Canyon of the Yellowstone at Calcite Springs, and the gorge of the Black Canyon all are due, at least in part, to the forces of running water and gravity.In the Lamar River Canyon lie exposed outcrops of gneiss and schist which are among the oldest rocks known in Yellowstone, perhaps more than two billion years old. Little is known about their origin due to their extreme age. Through time, heat and pressure have altered these rocks from their original state, further obscuring their early history. Only in the Gallatin Range are older outcrops found within the boundaries of the park.</p>
    <p>This area is also the junction to get to Lamar Valley. One of the most famous places in the park to view wildlife. Located in the northeastern corner of the park, the Lamar Valley, along the Lamar River, in is often called America’s Serengeti for its large and easy-to-see populations of large animals. Among its most famous inhabitants are the Junction Butte and Lamar Canyon wolf packs; wolf enthusiasts gather with spotting scopes most days hoping to see these impressive canines in action. In addition to wolves, other animals roaming the Lamar include large herds of bison, pronghorn, badgers, grizzly bears, bald eagles, osprey, deer, and coyotes. Many pullouts line the road, so keep your eyes peeled and park in the nearest one if you see any active wildlife. If you can tear your eyes away from the wildlife, the Lamar Valley also offers several points of interest. Two small, primitive campgrounds—Slough Creek and Pebble Creek—are here, and they make ideal launching points for early-rising wildlife watchers. Yellowstone Forever's Lamar Buffalo Ranch hosts students enrolled in the association’s many field programs. Soda Butte is all that is left of a hot spring cone located just off the road in the valley’s east side. And Trout Lake, a short hike from the road, is a great place to stretch your legs.</p>
