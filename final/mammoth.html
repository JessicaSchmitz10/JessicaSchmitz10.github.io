    <h1>Mammoth Hot Springs</h1>
        <p>Mammoth is the main hub of Yellowstone having the courthouse, jail, and one of the largest hospitals in the park. Mammoth is sometimes referred to as the "town" of Yellowstone as it is historically Fort Yellowstone. It is the first attraction reached from the North enterance and is only about 10 miles from Gardner, Montana. Many stop here for a large complex of hot springs on a hill of tavertine. It was created over thousands of years as hot water from the spring cooled and deposited calcium carbonate (over two tons flow into Mammoth each day in a solution). Because of the huge amount of geothermal vents, travertine flourishes. Although these springs lie outside the caldera boundary, their energy has been attributed to the same magmatic system that fuels other Yellowstone geothermal areas. </p>
        <p> Many also visit this area for wildlife. This is home for most Elk in the park and can often be found here during the rut season. There also are pronghorns, big horn sheep, badgers, mule deer, bison, and coyotes in this area.</p>
