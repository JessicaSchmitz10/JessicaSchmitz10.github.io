      <P>Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling between spring and autumn. The date of the beginning of summer varies according to climate, tradition and culture, but when it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In the Northern Hemisphere summer lasts from the Summer Solstice (about 21 June) to the Autumnal Equinox (September 22 or 23). In the Southern Hemisphere, summer lasts from December until March. At the summer solstice, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day-length decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The 1st day of summer 2019 in Northern Hemisphere will be on Friday, June 21st. And the last day of summer 2019 will be on Monday, September 23rd.</P>
